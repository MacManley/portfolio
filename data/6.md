OnSite is an app to help contractors and tradesmen keep track of their past and ongoing work, allowing them to capture and upload photos, log important info and keep records of their work, all from their mobile phone. It also registers contact details and service interval information to sites.

# Development

## Beta Testing

The app is currently in the development phase, and is to be trialed with select individuals across Cork County before being published to the App Store. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in testing the app or development!

## Programming

It is written in Swift for iOS and iPadOS. The majority of the app is written with SwiftUI, with a few components restricted to UIKit. 

The app works completely offline, however online functionality, allowing multiple users to share sites, is planned for 2026, allowing the sharing of sites among employees and employers.
