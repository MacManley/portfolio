Glanmire Community College's CanSat 2023 entry would be the first CanSat team in almost 6 years under the school. The team won regional finals and took part in the hotly contested national finals in Laois.

# Satelite Details

## Microcontroller

We used an Arduino Uno R3 as the microcontroller for the satelite due to the team's prior experience, the wide pin array and 5V availability. The board was powered using a 9V battery via a PP3 connector.

## Primary Mission

The primary mission is set by the European Space Agency, mandating all teams must be able to;
* Send and receive data wirelessly
* Read barometric pressure, thus calculating the height above sea level
* Read temperature data

To read pressure data, we chose the MPX4115A Pressure sensor, wiring it up to one of the analog ports. The height above sea level is then calculated from this pressure data

To read temperature data, we used a standard thermistor positioned at the bottom of the can where airflow entered, calibrating it using ice water and a hairdryer. We used SRS Thermistor Calculator to calculate the Steinhart coefficients, allowing us to calculate the given temperature at any point mathematically in our code. The thermistor was connected to another analog port.

A secondary temperature sensor was added to the top of the can to measure the temperature differntial due to airflow in the can. The DHT22 also measures humidity, giving us an extra datapoint.

To transmit data, the APC220 radio module was chosen. The RX was connected to the Arduino's TX to allow the transmition of the Uno's serial data to the ground. Another APC220 was connected to a DFRobot TTL to USB adaptor to read serial data using an application like SerialTools.

## Secondary Mission

As it was the schools first time running a secondary mission, there was no specific aim. Various sensors were added to retrieve additional data such as;

* Carbon Monoxide
* GPS 
* IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)

An MQ7 was used to measure Carbon Monoxide levels in the air. The sensor was pre-heated to allow proper measurements to be taken, as the internal material in the sensor works best when heated.

A ublox NEO-6M module was used for GPS communication. Metrics such as altitude, land speed, latitude and longitude could be logged. This was especially useful when retrieving the can, as it's location could be pinpointed via the radio communications.

The MPU6050 IMU was implemented to read gyroscopic datapoints and acceleration. The sensor was scrapped for both of the finals due to a repeating terminal issue with the sensors.

# Can Design 

## Assembly

7 iterations of the can were made up until the National Finals. Fusion 360 was used to model the final can shell, comprised of 2 parts;

* Left Side
* Right Side

The two sides were printed using an Ender 3 V2 and a Dremel 3D40. Both sides interlock using jigsaw cutouts and for extra security screw into brass threaded inserts. The electronics are mounted to a 90Â° aluminum bracket that attaches to the top of the left side via the fisheye bolt. The parachute is looped through and tied to the fisheye bolt.
