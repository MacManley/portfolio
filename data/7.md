Glanmire Community College's two VEX Robotics team competed in the 2023 Regional Championship in MTU. I was on Team A, the Transition Year team. Team A won best presentation and display.

# Game Premise

The VEX Robotics competition in 2023 was run under the objective "Spin-Up". Different objectives would earn teams points. Each team consisted of 2 robots.

* Score points by shooting discs into a high goal (5 pts) or a low goal (1 pt)
* Claim rollers on the side of the field (10 pts)
* In the endgame, robots have 10 seconds to cover as much floor tiles as they can. Each floor tile counts as 3 pts.

# Robot Details

## Robot Operation

All vex robotics robots featured a "brain" that would connect motors and sensors together, allowing the robot to be controlled and monitored from a gamepad-like device. 

The robot consisted of a tank drive setup with 4 motors. This allowed for extremely versatile and robust movement. The left and right analog stick were mapped to drive these motors, allowing individual control of the motors on each side.

## Robot Mechanisms

The robot featured an intake on the front that rolls discs onto the front tray. These are mapped to the left bumper and trigger. Two motors drive the front intake. 

The intake feeds the discs into the catapult, which launches discs into the high goals. This is controlled by the right bumper and trigger. A portion of the catapult gear was cut off to allow the catapult to snap backwards due to a band pulling against it. A single motor with a lower gear ratio allowed for greater torque to overcome the force of the resistance band.

The endgame is comprised of string with that was dispersed by a single motor rotating two beams up and out of the robot during the endgame. To prevent accidental activation that could cause jams or movement issues, a combination of "Y" and "Down" was required to activate it. Once activated, the ring on the end of the string would be flung off of the beams and onto an adjacent tile, widening the footprint of the robot.

## Timeframe

The robot was built over the course of 3 days.
