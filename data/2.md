Glanmire Community College's CanSat 2024 entry carried on from the 2023 entry with major upgrades and improvements after learning a lot from the previous attempt

# Satelite Details

## Microcontroller

We used an ESP8266 as the microcontroller for the satelite due to it's small size and great processing power. The board was powered using a 3.6V LiPo battery.

## Primary Mission

The primary mission is set by the European Space Agency, mandating all teams must be able to;
* Send and receive data wirelessly
* Read barometric pressure, thus calculating the height above sea level
* Read temperature data

To read pressure and temperature data, we chose the BME680. This sensor compacted a lot of metrics into one singular chip, saving space and allowing more sensors to be packed into the internals. It uses I2C communication, which is  important as the ESP8266 only has one analog port without using a multiplexer that would take up aditional space.

To transmit data, the APC220 radio module was chosen. The RX was connected to the ESP8266's TX to allow the transmition of the serial data to the ground. Another APC220 was connected to a DFRobot TTL to USB adaptor to read serial data using an application like SerialTools.


## Secondary Mission

The secondary mission evaluated the feasibility of human life on the planet the CanSat descends and lands upon. The information was fed into an AI model, as well as being judged by humans, to give a percentage probability that the planet would be habitable. The AI was trained over the course of the development using real data. A variety of sensors helped evaluate habitability using common biomarkers for biological life such as;

* UV Index
* Humidity and VOC Level
* Gravity Strength

Other sensors were added that did not directly contribute to this mission, but were crucial for the cans operation such as;

* IMU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer)
* GPS

The AS7331 mesasures the UV and thus calculates the UV Index of the planet. This was connected to the analog pin.

The BME680 offered VOC and Humidity levels alongside the already provided temperature and air pressure readings. 

Gravity strength was inferred via the MPU6050, scrapped during the previous year of CanSat. Accelerometer and Gyroscope values could also be read to determine general acceleration and orientation. The sensor uses I2C communication on the same data line as the BME680 with a different address. 

A ublox NEO-6M module was used for GPS communication. Metrics such as altitude, land speed, latitude and longitude could be logged. This was especially useful when retrieving the can, as it's location could be pinpointed via the radio communications.

# Can Design 

## Assembly

Over 30 iterations of the can were modeled throughout the cans development. Fusion 360 was used to model the final can core and shell, comprised of 3 parts;

* Outer Shell
* Can Lid
* Center Core

The outer shell servers as the cans protection and guides airflow throughout the can. The inside of the shell includes two grooves so the center core and lid can assemble with the can. The shell and lid includes two screw holes for extra security. The shell has cutouts in the bottom and top for airflow to flow into the can for cooling and correct measurements. A "landing pad" was created for the competition to cool the can while idling.

The can lid includes a strengthened fisheye bolt made from PLA+ to save space and integrate it into the can lid. The top of the can features cutouts and indentations for the UV sensor and GPS sensor to give them the most accurate readings and improve connectivity. A waterproof nylon mesh was placed over the holes to ensure component safety.

The center core houses all sensors. By designing it in Fusion 360, it allows for the meticulous placement of sensors for airflow and saving space. It featured threaded holes and cutouts for pins to be routed throughout the can, creating a clean design.
