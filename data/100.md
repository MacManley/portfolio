As part of Glanmire Community College, I produced a H1 project in Leaving Cert Technology. 

# Project Brief

According to the brief released for 2024-2025 Leaving Cert in late September, the project brief was;

``` In a context of your choice, and with a focus on modern materials and processes, design and manufacture a working model of a device, system, product, and/or interactive display that promotes or contributes to sustainable consumption in our lives. Your solution should include an electro-mechanical element and should be well presented.```
