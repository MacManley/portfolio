I am currently in the prototyping phase of a custom Automatic Material System \(AMS) unit for the Ender 3 V2, the printer I own personally.

# Printer History

## Previous Modifications

I have previously installed various OEM and DIY mods on my Ender 3 V2;

* Custom Direct Drive Extrusion System
* CR-Touch
* mini Satsana Cooling

# Prerequisites

In order to allow the proper frameworks to allow me to install a custom AMS unit, I first needed to make a few changes;

* Install a processor to offboard processing and handle filament changes
* Install a filament cutter and runout sensor
* Add a mounting spot for these components

## Processor

I decided to choose the Rasberry Pi Zero 2W as it is the most efficient and smallest board that is able to run various 3D printing firmwares like Klipper and OctoPi. I decided to install Klipper as it is highly expandable in the future with other features like pressure advance and input shaping.

## Filament Cutter

I am currently in the ideation phase of a filament cutter that would work alongside a filament runout sensor and the custom direct drive extruder already in my print head.

## Filament Runout Sensor

I am debating whether to buy Creality's official runout sensor or make my own version. I am evaluating the official product's compatability with previous/ongoing upgrades.

## Mounting

Due to my choice of the compact Rasberry Pi Zero 2W, I was able to mount it in the motherboard bay of the original Ender 3 V2 motherboard. I created a custom motherboard undertray with extra cooling vents and slots for USB/mini HDMI outputs using Fusion 360 and 3D printed it using black PLA+. I currently have not swapped the fan as I believe it should be enough to cool both the main motherboard and the Zero 2W.

To mount the Zero 2W, I used a generic 3D-printable design from Thingiverse that clips onto the available V-slot extrusion channel in the motherboard bay.
