As part of UCC'S Rocketry and Space Exploration Society, I am helping develop the electronic systems for the CanSat and advising with the Hardware Avionics team for the Mach '26 entry, codenamed Cerberus. Alongside this, I also advised for the beginning of the to-be-named joint UCC and MTU EuRoc entry.

# Rocket

Cerberus is planned to be entered as a Category 3 rocket, reaching a planned apogee of 1.5-3km, and in line with the UKRA Model Rocket Safety Code.

# CanSat

## Mission

The CanSat is to feature in the Cerebrus rocket with a custom flight computer that logs various data points. This includes the 3 atmospheric readings required to be logged by the rocket to be classed as planned as a Category 3 Rocket. The CanSat will seperate from the two-stage rocket at apogee.

## Platform

The CanSat computer is modelled on a custom purpose-made PCB, powered by a Rasberry Pi Pico 2. It features a second microcontroller, the ESP32-CAM, to take photos during the flight. The Rasberry Pi Pico 2 communicate to the ESP32-Cam via one-way communication to notify it to take photos at specific time-sensitive points (e.g apogee).
