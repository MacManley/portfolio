Since 2024 I have worked on a variety of simulation game telemetry parsers and data scrapers for retrieving website and game data to be used in programs and devices.

## C++/ESP8266 Telemetry Parsers

My main focus through my work on telemetry parsers are libraries to be run on microcontrollers such as the ESP8266 and ESP32. I provide Arduino libraries for a variety of racing games such as;

* F1 25/24/23
* Gran Turismo 7
* Assetto Corsa (Xbox/PS4)
* Project Cars 2

These libraries allow datapoints from the UDP telemetry to be accessed and used in users code. Different libraries include additional features, for example built-in handshake negotiation and packet decryption. Each library features thorough documentation, examples and research in, which helps users with using the libraries functions and datapoints. 

## Python Telemetry Parsers

I have created currently one telemetry parser in Python. It captures and displays GT7 position data to create track maps and show metrics such as throttle and braking overlayed on the track map using gradient colours. 

## Javascript

The gt7-leaderboards library is a niche program I made to retrieve sport mode data and display it in a variety of graphs. Info such as manufacturer and nation frequency can be analysed through various different scripts. The data is displayed using pie charts, heatmaps, histograms and various other options.
