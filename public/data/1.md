Gymificient was the culmination of the Patch 2024 programme. 30+ of Europe's best programmers, engineers and artists converged in Dublin for 7 weeks to bring big ideas and companies to life at Patch.

# Backend Development

## Python Script

I led the development of the Python script that would analyse the gym environment and send analytics to the database. 

The UI was created using Tkinter. It allows gym owners to remove or add IP Cameras using network search, and view a camera to see processing in real time. Alongside this, I developed a region of interest selector for gym owners to select and name the machines they want monitored. 

The processing was done using OpenCV's Python library. Due to the scripts usage on a local computer in the gym, a lightweight processing algorithm was needed. I built a custom frame differencing algorithm to monitor changes in the area around machines to collect insights. The script showed inpressive accuracy, being able to differentiate between a water bottle or towel on a machine versus an actual person sititng down. The script would actively monitor machine status and send data off-site every 15 minutes.

I received amazing advice and feedback from mentors at Zalando, OpenAI and Precision Sports Technology during the process of building the script that I am forever grateful for.

## Azure

I led the management and upkeep of the Azure SQL Server. Various metrics such as usage time, unique persons using the machine, and average usage time are collected and sent to the SQL Server from the Python programme. User info was also stored and encrypted.

# Frontend Development

## Blazor Website

My co-founder, Jakub, led the development of the website, with a background of developing video games in C#. The website includes a homepage and login page, where gym owners could sign in and access analytics through intuitive graphs and metrics, with AI analysis on machine performance compared to usual trends. The homepage included a demo of our service and allowed interested parties to contact the team for further queries and discussion. Blazor allowed us to seamlessly implement server-side rendering into our site without hassle.

## Website Hosting

The website was hosted on a Linux VM on Azure. This was connected to Github, where the team could make fast changes and preview them before being deployed to the site. We bought the domain gymificient.com and routed it to our website using Azure. 

# Marketing

Udaiveer was in charge of marketing. We secured 2 design partners before the end of the programme, and contacted countless gyms for feedback on the idea. The system was trialed in our accomodations gym, being used to show potential design partners and investors.

# Pitching

I ultimately led the pitch for both Demo Day and the recording sessions, taking full responsibility for presenting our project to stakeholders, mentors and a wider audience from Dogpatch Labs. I received expert advice from various mentors at Stripe, Dogpatch Labs, and the University of Limerick on pitching. Their experience helped enhance my storytelling and delivery of the pitch, while also giving valuable points about things to change in our pitch deck.
